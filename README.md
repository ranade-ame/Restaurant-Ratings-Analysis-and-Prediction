# Restaurant-Ratings-Analysis-and-Prediction
Problem Statement Zomato users rely heavily on the rating system that the platform offers when deciding which restaurant to dine in or order from. The problem is to identify the factors that affect the ratings of the restaurants, which further has a direct effect on the decision making of the end user.  Objectives  Choosing the perfect dataset for this project and cleaning it for implementation of Machine Learning algorithms. To identify the factors that have a direct effect on the rating of a restaurant and see if we can use these factors to correctly predict the rating of any restaurant.  To perform analysis on the dataset in order to infer any relation between the restaurant types and ratings, location and ratings. To visualize and infer facts by plotting the distribution of number of restaurants over location, the frequency of different types of restaurants and the most popular restaurant chains in Bengaluru.
